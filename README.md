# ENG5220-Real-Time-Embedded-Programming_Haptic_Navigation_Vest
Haptic Navigation Vest is a real-time embedded systems project that provides non-audio obstacle awareness for visually impaired users. The wearable vest uses ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback to deliver intuitive, low-latency navigation cues, enabling safer and more independent movement without blocking environmental sounds.
